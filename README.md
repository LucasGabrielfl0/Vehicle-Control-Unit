# Integrated-VCU
Integration of the VCU, the car's safety sensors(APPS, BSE, ...), the Electronic differential and CAN 2.0

## Getting Started!

To decrease the complexity of the main code and improve it's safety, a few header files were created:

-  adc_sensors
-  can_communication
-  control_system
-  telemetry_system

### Powertrain Header
The header files above were put in the Powertrain folder and called by the .h file below

```
Powertrain.h
```
